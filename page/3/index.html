<h2 id="Transcript"><a href="#Transcript" class="headerlink" title="Transcript"></a>Transcript</h2><p>On August 12, 2020, two groups of girls went out to protest in <strong>Minsk</strong>, the capital city of <strong>Belarus</strong>. They put on white clothes and went barefoot out into the street. In the morning, some went to Komarovskiy Market in the center of town. Later that day, the other group gathered with flowers at the eternal flame under the victory monument. They stood together holding hands, and they started to sing <strong>the Belarusian lullaby</strong>, waiting for the police cars to arrive. They knew the police would pick them up just like that: barefoot with flowers in their hands, that they would take them to the police station, beat them up and try to humiliate them. And yet they did it anyway. </p>
<p>This year, something changed in Belarus, a country of more than nine million people that has been ruled by an <strong>authoritarian</strong> leader since 1994. These young women were protesting the latest <strong>rigged</strong> election result, which had taken [place] just a few days earlier. Their small expressions of protest very quickly expanded into massive, peaceful, women-led demonstrations all across the country. </p>
<p>Within just a few days, a few hundred thousand people took to the streets and demonstrations have continued ever since, <strong>the likes of which</strong> Belarus has never seen before. All this despite the fact that the president proclaimed himself reelected and that more than 10,000 people have been detained, hundreds tortured and at least six killed. </p>
<p>Many people wonder why the people of Belarus are speaking up now. What makes them keep <strong>taking to</strong> the streets despite unprecedented police violence, despite state lawlessness? The answer I hear the most is that people have become fearless, and it’s something we have become together. </p>
<p>Because fear is the <strong>province</strong> of one. It feeds on isolation. It doesn’t discriminate: men, women, children, elderly – all of us can feel fear, but only as long as we are on our own. Fearlessness takes two. It only works if and when we show up for each other. Show up so that your neighbor, your colleague, your friend has courage. And they will do the same for you. </p>
<p>A lot has been made of my own role in the presidential election of August 2020. How I stepped in to run for my husband, Sergei, when he was jailed and it became clear that the authorities would deny him his chance to run himself; how I rightfully won the election and became the elected leader of a democratic Belarus, but the official results only gave me 10 percent of the vote and I was forced into <strong>exile</strong> with my children; how I still fight for those who voted for me and whose voice the <strong>regime</strong> wants to steal; how “fearless” I am. </p>
<p>But there were many moments when I was frightened, and I wanted to step down. I was threatened and forced to believe that I’m alone in this fight. And yet the more cities I visited, the more people showed up for the rallies, the less fear I had. And then in the days before the election in Minsk, 60,000 people came to show their support for me, and I was no longer afraid. </p>
<p>I never wanted to do any of this. I was never overly political, and I never planned to run for office. I wanted to be a mom and a wife. But by fate and the will of my people, I was elevated to this position. And I accept this with a sense of duty and pride. I will not give up. And I will show up for people, because they show up for me. Our courage is born from unity. Our <strong>solidarity</strong> is our strength. </p>
<p>I also now understand that being fearless is a commitment. It is a decision you make every single day. It is a responsibility you take – responsibility for one another. In this regard, I’m no different from my fellow Belarusians. Their support is tangible. Their solidarity grows in <strong>progression</strong>. When there are two of you, you are <strong>daring</strong>. When you’re 100, you are brave. When there are thousands of you, you are fearless. And once you are tens of thousands, you become <strong>invincible</strong>. </p>
<p>Thank you. </p>

<h2 id="Transcript"><a href="#Transcript" class="headerlink" title="Transcript"></a>Transcript</h2><p>Growing up in <strong>Missouri</strong>, they would kind of take us out into the woods, and they would give you a map, and they would give you a compass, and you had to find your way home. And without the compass, you can’t even read the map. That’s what I’m here to tell you. The compass is the key. </p>
<p>A compass is most simply a piece of metal that has been <strong>magnetized</strong>, so that it will turn towards <strong>the Earth’s magnetic pole</strong>. The one that we all think of is <strong>the pocket compass</strong>. It looks like a watch, right? You can hold it in your hand and watch the little needle <strong>bounce around</strong> until you find north. </p>
<p><strong>Magnetism</strong> is still a pretty <strong>mysterious force</strong> to <strong>physicists</strong>, but what we do know for sure is that a compass works because the Earth is this giant <strong>magnet</strong>. And when you use a compass, you are in touch with the very center of our planet, where this kind of <strong>roiling ball of molten iron</strong> is <strong>spinning around</strong> and creating <strong>a magnetic field</strong>. Just like a magnet you can play with on your <strong>tabletop</strong>, it has a north pole and a south pole, and we use compasses to find our way north because of that <strong>fact</strong>. </p>
<p>The earliest known compass comes from about 200 BC in China. They figured out that some of the metal <strong>coming out of the ground</strong> was naturally magnetic, and so they <strong>fashioned</strong> this magnetized metal into this kind of <strong>ladle-looking</strong> thing, put it on a <strong>brass plate</strong> and then it would point north. It seems to have been primarily used to improve <strong>feng shui</strong>, so they could figure out what was the best way for <strong>energy to flow through their living spaces</strong>. </p>
<p>Sailors were probably the early <strong>adopters</strong> of the more portable versions of it, because no matter where the sun was, no matter what the condition of the stars were, they would always be able to find north. </p>
<p>Now, much later, the Europeans are the ones who <strong>innovate</strong> and <strong>come up with</strong> the <strong>compass rose</strong>. It essentially <strong>laid out</strong> what north, south, east and west looked like, and it also enabled you to kind of create new directions, like northwest, southeast, <strong>what have you</strong>. And for the first time, they knew where they were going. That’s kind of a big deal. </p>
<p>But also, I think it was part of this general <strong>reinvigoration</strong> of European science. You might know it as the <strong>Renaissance</strong>. Lots of new tools were invented, from the telescope to the microscope. </p>
<p>Maps got better because of compasses, right? Because then you start to understand <strong>which direction is which</strong>, you get a lot more detail, and that just kind of changes the human relationship to the world. The compass with a map is like a superpower. Everything that we think of as world history would not have taken place without the compass: <strong>the age of exploration</strong>, <strong>Magellan circumnavigating the globe</strong>, even the fact that we know it is a globe. </p>
<p>The compass ends up getting embedded in all these other tools, because it is such a functional object. So you might have it embedded in your multi-tool, you might have it embedded in your phone. The compass is everywhere, because it’s literally how we find our way across the face of the Earth. So you can go off and explore, and find out what is over that next hill or that next <strong>horizon</strong>, but you can also reliably find your way home. </p>

<h2 id="Dictation"><a href="#Dictation" class="headerlink" title="Dictation"></a>Dictation</h2><p>I was not one of those kids that know exactly what they wanted to do when they were grown up. In fifteen years of my career, I’ve been English teacher, <strong>attorney</strong>, <strong>video game creator</strong>, and now a toilet paper salesman sales <strong>millions of rows of  toilet paper</strong> a year.</p>
<p>Life is about finding the <strong>intersection</strong> of what you really really love with what you really really good at. <strong>As simple as it sounds</strong>, it’s really not that easy to find. After a brief <strong>stand</strong> as an English teacher I went to a law school and <strong>ended up</strong> becoming attorney at a really big law firm here in New York City. Like most Americans, for the next two to three years, I was <strong>holding on to</strong> my job for dear life, worked really late hours at a job that I thought maybe I was good at but certainly not one that I really really love. I then <strong>came upon</strong> that <strong>epiphany</strong>, that takes years <strong>if not</strong> tens of thousands of hours to get really good at  something. I really didn’t have a lot of time to waste. </p>
<p>This talk isn’t for those looking to quit their job because they don’t like their boss or they had a long day of work. This is for those who are ready to <strong>make the completely scary leap</strong> into a brand new career. So, as you think about making a career change, here are a few tips I hope you can consider and a few things I’ve <strong>picked up along the way</strong>.</p>
<p>First, there <em>are</em> three things to think about before you’re ready to move on. No. one, professional life is about learning. If you are not even interested in learning anymore, that’s a huge <strong>red flag</strong> that there might not be a future for you in that industry. No. two, career changes are often <strong>gut</strong> driven, if you constantly have sleepless night or you just  right awake and staring at the ceiling, thinking “Oh, man, I can’t live with myself if I never try to make this change or if I don’t even actually investigate it.” Then trust your gut. It might be time for that career change. <strong>On the flip side</strong>, one reason to not move on is short-term pain. If you don’t like your boss, or people at the office at <strong>grating on</strong> you. That’s actually not a really good reason to absolutely change your career because when you do change a career you generally have to start from the bottom and you’ll probably feel a lot of short-term pain whether it’s through a lack of salary or a lack of tittle, pain at any job is inevitable.</p>
<p>So, now you are <strong>convinced</strong> it’s time to change the career. Then there <em>are</em> three things to do immediately. First, network, network, network. No one ever builds a good career without a good <strong>mentor</strong> or good support network. What I mean by networking is getting all the great advice you can possibly get. Technology has make it so simple to reach out to new people to say “Hey, I’m thinking about making a career change. Do you have five minutes to chat with me?” That passion, that hunger and that ability to be a <strong>sponge</strong> really attracts awesome mentors and people willing to give you their time to give you some good advice. Let’s go out there and meet new people. The second thing you need to do immediately is to <strong>shore up</strong> your finances. The reality is when you change your career, you’ll’ either start with a job with a lower tittle or lower pay or maybe even no pay, especially if you’re starting your own business. So, going out there and making sure your finances are in order to make the transition less painful is really really important. For me personally, as I made the transition from being an attorney over to a video game creator, I wanted to have at least six to twelve months of personal <strong>runway</strong> in the bank. You know, six to twelve months, might not be the right number for you, but be honest with yourself, what that number should be? No. three, if you are not ready to make the full jump right at this moment, then get your <strong>side hustle</strong> on.  Side hustles could be any thing from volunteering with an organization that’s in that industry you wanna go into,  could be starting your business part-time on the weekends. It’s a free way to get a taste to see if you really really love something.</p>
<p>So you are ready to make the move or maybe you already made the move,  Here are three things you should think about doing right now. One, don not, I repeat, do not burn bridges. You spent years building that bridge, why burn them now? The world is such a small place especially with all these online platforms, that believe me, you’ll see these people again and probably in the most <strong>inopportune</strong> times. No. two, <strong>take stock of</strong> what you’ve learnt in your previous career or careers. Most likely, a lot of those things are <strong>applicable</strong> to your new jobs or new career. There is interacting with people, playing on a team, or whether it’s dealing with jerks or dealing with assholes,  All those things are universally applicable. You’ll find jerks no matter what industry you’re in, No one is <strong>immune</strong> to it. Everyone’s got figure it out, and you probably know how to do it already. And lastly, when you start your new job, I know you’re gonna be nervous, but don’t worry, take a deep breath, because this is what I wanna tell you. You are part of a new team now, and everyone around you is <strong>rooting for</strong> your success, because your success is their success. So welcome to your new career.</p>
